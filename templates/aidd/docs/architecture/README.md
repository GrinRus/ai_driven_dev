# Architecture Profile

`profile.md` is the source of truth for architecture boundaries, invariants, and allowed dependencies.

## Who updates it
- Owner of the repository architecture (or designated team).

## When to update
- Added/renamed modules or directory roots.
- Changed dependency boundaries or invariants.
- Updated test/format policy or project skills.

## Customize stack
- See `customize.md` for stack hints and workflow customization.

## If in doubt
- Record conflicts as a risk or handoff and update the profile before implementation.
