# SKILL: dev-run

## Name
Run / dev server

## Version
1.0

## When to use
- You need to run the app locally or start a dev server.

## Commands
### Run
- <run command from project>

### Dev server
- <dev server command>

## Evidence
- Save logs under: `aidd/reports/tests/<ticket>.<ts>.dev.log` if you run anything locally.
- In the response, include the log path and a 1-line summary.

## Pitfalls
- Ensure required env vars are present.
- Avoid running long-lived servers unless necessary.

## Tooling
- Prefer documented project scripts over custom shell commands.
