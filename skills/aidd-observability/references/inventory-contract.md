# Inventory Contract

- `tools_inventory.py` is the canonical source for runtime ownership/consumer matrix.
- Keep entrypoint classification stable (`shared_skill`, `canonical_stage`, `hook_entrypoint`).
- Inventory outputs must remain deterministic and CI-consumable.
- Update tests and docs when command owners move.
