description: Aggregates shared runtime navigation and cross-skill ownership links. Use when resolving shared runtime entrypoints or ownership boundaries.

## Purpose
- This skill is the thin runtime-oriented navigation layer.
- Policy guidance (output contract, question format, read discipline, loop safety) lives in `feature-dev-aidd:aidd-policy`.
- Domain owners are split into dedicated shared skills (`aidd-docio`, `aidd-flow-state`, `aidd-observability`, `aidd-loop`, `aidd-rlm`).
- Agents may reference `feature-dev-aidd:aidd-core` as the topology entrypoint and navigation hub.

## Canonical shared Python entrypoints
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-rlm/runtime/rlm_slice.py`
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/diff_boundary_check.py`
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/plan_review_gate.py`
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/prd_review_gate.py`
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/rlm_targets.py`
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/skill_contract_validate.py`

## Command contracts
### `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/skill_contract_validate.py`
- When to run: before release or CI checks when skill contract drift is suspected.
- Inputs: repository root plus optional filters for prompt/skill validation scope.
- Outputs: deterministic validation diagnostics for contract and prompt structure issues.
- Failure mode: non-zero exit when required contract fields/sections are missing or inconsistent.
- Next action: fix reported contract gaps in owners, then rerun the same validator.

### `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/aidd-core/runtime/diff_boundary_check.py`
- When to run: during loop/review orchestration before applying actions that may cross boundaries.
- Inputs: diff metadata (`--ticket`, `--scope-key`, optional work-item context).
- Outputs: boundary verdict (`ok|warn|blocked`) and evidence references.
- Failure mode: non-zero exit when diff inputs are missing or policy boundary checks fail.
- Next action: tighten scope/actions or hand off blocker, then rerun the boundary check.

## Ownership guard
- `aidd-core` owns only aggregator-level shared runtime modules.
- Policy/procedure text must be hosted in `feature-dev-aidd:aidd-policy`.

## Additional resources
- Policy contract: [../aidd-policy/SKILL.md](../aidd-policy/SKILL.md) (when: output/read/question rules are needed; why: apply shared policy without duplicating stage docs).
- DocIO runtime owner: [../aidd-docio/SKILL.md](../aidd-docio/SKILL.md) (when: actions/map/markdown tooling is needed; why: use canonical DocIO entrypoints from a dedicated shared skill).
- Flow/state runtime owner: [../aidd-flow-state/SKILL.md](../aidd-flow-state/SKILL.md) (when: stage state/progress/tasklist lifecycle tools are needed; why: use dedicated flow-state entrypoints).
- Observability runtime owner: [../aidd-observability/SKILL.md](../aidd-observability/SKILL.md) (when: diagnostics/inventory/log/report commands are needed; why: keep observability surface under a dedicated shared owner).
- Context pack template source: [templates/context-pack.template.md](templates/context-pack.template.md) (when: context pack format is unclear; why: confirm canonical sections generated by init/runtime).
